## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

This application is designed to be easily customizable.

### 1. Social Media Links

To update the social media links on the "About Me" page, edit the `socialLinks` array in the following file:

`src/components/about/about.component.ts`

```typescript
export class AboutComponent {
  socialLinks = [
    {
      name: 'GitHub',
      icon: 'fab fa-github',
      url: 'YOUR_GITHUB_URL_HERE', 
      // ...
    },
    {
      name: 'Pinterest',
      icon: 'fab fa-pinterest',
      url: 'YOUR_PINTEREST_URL_HERE',
      // ...
    },
    // Add more or edit existing ones
  ];
}
```

### 2. Feedback Form Endpoint

The feedback form uses [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) for submission. To direct the feedback to your own email address:

1.  Create a new form on Formspree.
2.  Get your unique form endpoint URL.
3.  Replace the `action` attribute in the `<form>` tag in the following file:

`src/components/feedback/feedback.component.html`

```html
<form action="YOUR_FORMSPREE_URL_HERE" method="POST" class="space-y-4">
    <!-- Form fields -->
</form>
```
